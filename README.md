# tcalifornicus_projects
## This repository includes odds-and-ends associated with Tigriopus projects, in the form of scripts and instructions
#### [1] TCALIF_promoter_instructions: instructions for how to extract upstream promoter regions for a genome not currently available through Bioconductor packages (based on "Bioinformatics Data Skills" by Vince Buffalo)
#### [2] EdgeR_mRNA_data: instructions for how to perform a basic differential expression analysis in program EdgeR, with specific commands and example output for those commands
#### [3] TCALIF_mirdeep2_protocol: instructions on how to utilize the mirdeep2 pipeline for identifying miRNAs from sequencing data, with specific commands and explanations (involves mirbase mature miRNAs - mirbase_mature_jan_2018.fa)
#### [4] TCALIF_RNAseq_protocol: commands and flags for aligning mRNA reads to a reference using Bowtie2, or quasi-align the reads using SALMON, plus quantification using SALMON
#### [5] TCALIF_TopGO: instructions for how to use TopGO in R for idenifying Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with significantly differentially expressed genes
#### [6] edgeR_contrasts_between_times.R: instructions for how to compare different time points against each other, in combination with their controls
